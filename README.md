# 👋 Hello, Everyone!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Senior Rust Developer** with a deep passion for systems programming, high-performance software, and decentralized technologies. I specialize in writing safe, concurrent, and fast applications with Rust, and I love contributing to open source projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible in modern computing.

## 🦀 Core Competencies

### 🚀 Systems & Backend Development
- **Rust-first development** for backends, CLIs, embedded devices, and WebAssembly.
- Built scalable microservices using **Actix**, **Axum**, and **Tokio** with advanced async patterns.
- Architected robust APIs, integrated **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and used **Diesel** and **SeaORM** for database layers.

### ⚙️ Blockchain & Smart Contracts
- Deep understanding of **Substrate** (Polkadot), **Solana**, **NEAR Protocol (Rust + near-sdk)**, and **CosmWasm**.
- Experience developing:
  - Consensus modules, runtime pallets, and validator logic (Substrate).
  - NFT minting platforms and token protocols (NEAR, Solana).
  - Rust-powered dApps integrated with wallets and relayers.

### 🧠 WebAssembly & Cross-Platform Development
- Created high-performance **WebAssembly** apps compiled from Rust.
- Built desktop apps using **Tauri** and cross-compiled Rust libraries to native platforms.
- Leveraged `wasm-bindgen`, `trunk`, and `yew` for building interactive web frontends.

### 🛠️ DevOps & Tooling
- Containerized services using **Docker**, configured with **Nix** and deployed via **GitHub Actions** and **Terraform**.
- Built internal devtools, profilers, and testing frameworks using `proptest`, `criterion`, and fuzzers.
